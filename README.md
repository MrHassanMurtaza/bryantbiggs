## The Deets

#### Who am I

Just an engineer passionate about cloud infrastructure, serverless technologies, and helping teams build out their infrastructure and processes for scale

#### What I do

Currently working on achieving "the dream" with [Clowd Haus](https://github.com/clowdhaus) (pronounced ‚òÅÔ∏è üè†)! In addition, you can also find me contributing back to open source projects like [Terraform AWS Modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules) and [Terraform provider AWS](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws)

#### Why you should reach out

- You are looking for help building out your AWS environment following the [Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)
- You want to adopt infrastructure as code in your team and could use some help with Terraform and IaC practices, conventions, standards
- You are interested in building out and adopting a serverless architecture on AWS for scalability
- Help with any combination of the above points - AWS, Terraform, infrastructure as code, cloud native, serverless `#allTheThings`
